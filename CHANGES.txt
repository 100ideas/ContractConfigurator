Contract Configurator 0.5.0
- RemoteTech integration!
  - KSCConnectivity parameter - indicates that a vessel must have connectivity back to mission control.
  - HasAntenna parameter - indicates that a vessel must have one or more antenna that meet specific criteria.
  - SignalDelay parameter - requires a min/max signal delay for a connection.
